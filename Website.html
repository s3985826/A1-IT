		Personal Information <hr /> 
		<p>Hello, my name is Liam Higginson. I am an 18 year old first year in RMIT although previously I was a VCE student until I successfully graduated from Salesian College Chadstone. 
			I am currently doing my 3 year Bachelor of IT and some of my main hobbies include making music, lifting at the gym and playing videogames. I have been a little tech savvy since a 
			young age due to being introduced to computer games as a kid, with the assistance of my father who works IT jobs, I have attained somewhat basic knowledge when it comes to computer 
			hardware and surface functions. I attempt to be as disciplined as possible with my studying and lifting with a somewhat consistent routine throughout the weeks. Some of my personal 
			attributes include always trying my hardest to achieve a certain goal in mind and seeking out mentors or those more experienced than me in certain topics in order to gain more knowledge. 
			Although I may tend to lack some consistency as some days I lack the motivation to do certain tasks or do anything productive in general. An interesting fact about me is that I like 
			collecting sneakers (mostly Nike’s), as I find it quite addicting. </p>

		Interest in IT <hr /> 
		<p>As stated previously, my father works in the IT field, as well as some security work which initially got me interested. In addition to this, in high school I learned some game development 
			which exposed me to some programming (although I don’t remember what I did) which got me interested in information technology.  
			I chose to come to RMIT as I was already planning to do something IT related, although RMIT was the first university to send me their offer, so I took it. 
			From my studies I expect to learn the necessary skills in order to become a successful individual in world of Information Technology. Learning things like coding, databases, websites etc.  </p>
		Ideal Job <hr />
		<p>My ideal job would be to become a freelance programmer. https://www.freelancer.com.au/jobs/programming/. Freelance programmers are coders which work on programs on a contract, following 
			the client’s wishes. Their general job includes developing applications and software for a client. This job is particularly appealing to me as it allows me to be my own boss in a sense. Freelance 
			engineers can pick and choose their clients, have their own workflow as well as work from the comfort of their own home. As an individual who values solidarity this is particularly appealing to me. 
			Though this job requires extensive amounts of experience with coding, software development and even networking in order to find and appeal to clients. As of right now I have little to no 
			qualifications nor skills to become a freelance programmer, although I do possess very limited knowledge on HTML and Python. I plan on obtaining these skills through completing my 3 years at 
			RMIT and even pursuing more knowledge and skills if need be. </p>
		Personality Profile <hr />
		<p> Strengths </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Disciplined </li>
			<li>Hard-working</li>
			<li>Versatile</li>
			<li>Creative </li>
			<li>Determined </li>
		</ul>
		<p> Weaknesses </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Not Consistent </li>
			<li>Limited Experience</li>
			<li>Have trouble asking for assistance</li>
			<li>Prefer to work solo </li>
			
		</ul>
		<p>My personality type is INTJ-A according to https://www.16personalities.com/. According to this I have some perfectionist tendencies while being hard on myself. This is quite true in real world context. 
		Although in a team context, this personality archetype is very good to have, a hardworking individual can get lots of work done in an efficient manner, although this archetype has its drawback in team work 
		as they are quite introverted. This should be taken into account in team activities so individuals can get the position in which their personality type favour most in order to be more productive and have 
		less conflicts. These results are quite valid although the ‘perfectionist’ within me inconsistently represents itself, as some days I do not strive for perfection and may lack drive, but other days I am 
		energetic and strive for perfection.</p>

		<h2>Project Idea</h2>
		Overview <hr />
		<p>I plan to create an iPhone application called “Virtual Creps”, with this app users will be able to try on shoes virtually through foot recognising technology and 3D-electrical replication. The app will 
		feature many shoes as well as requests for certain shoes. In addition to this, features such as changing shoe colour and maybe even designing your own shoes will likely be implemented. This product is targeted 
		to sneakerheads and/or casual shoe shoppers in the age range of 13-26.</p> 
		Motivation <hr />
		<p>My motivation for this project is my habits with purchasing sneakers. When figuring out a project, I just thought of something that I would find useful in buying things. In addition, I have made some weak 
		financial decisions when it came to buying shoes, so this app would assist individuals with the way they spend their money on shoes. Also, there is a certain niche in the market which this app will fulfil when 
		developed and implemented.  </p>
		Description <hr />
		<p> The app “Virtual Creps” will be a free iPhone application targeted toward sneakerheads and/or casual shoe shoppers in the age range of 13-26. The app will feature a wide selection of Nike, Adidas, puma, 
		new balance and Asics shoes to pick and choose from. In addition to this, the app will have a query section in which users can search and select for a range of shoes they would like to see implemented in the 
		3D selection. Users will also be able to change colour and design of the shoes. The interface will be simplistic with a black background accompanied white/grey accents. Text will be displayed in lighter colours 
		as to contrast with the dark background. Once the user has opened the app, it will display a range of brands for certain shoes. The user is then able to select their desired brand and shoe. If the shoe they are 
		searching for does not appear, a user may send a suggestion as to shoes that should be added in an option on the page. This suggestion is then filtered, shoes with the most suggestions would have the highest 
		priority with implementation as to keep the larger base of users happy. In addition to this, once a user has selected a brand, a large array of shoes will be displayed in their own separate text boxes with the 
		shoes name, colour and a side profile of the shoe itself. On the top of this page will be a search filter in which users can select colourways of shoes or type in a name of the shoe they are looking for. 
		“Virtual Creps” will also likely feature a ‘design your own sneaker’ type of add-on in the opening menu. Upon opening this add-on users will be displayed with a template, this template can then be warped and 
		designed as the user sees fit, colour and background can also be manipulated. This app may also have a kids section for parents with children in the age-range of 4-8. This feature will likely have the 
		same and more brands, dedicated in shoes for children. </p>
		Tools and Technologies <hr />
		<p>I will need a foot recondition type of Artificial Intelligence as to place the 3D shoe on the user’s foot. Another piece of tech that I would need is a 3D scanner to scan the shoe to be implemented. 
		This scan would then be edited in a 3D editing software to touch it up. It is with these tools that the AI would recognise the foot, then place the 3D shoe which had been scanned on the foot.</p>
		Skills Required <hr />
		<ul>
			<li>3D Editing </li>
			<li>Knowledge in AI/Recognition Software</li>
			<li>Programming</li>
			<li>3D Scanning </li>
			<li>Database Knowledge</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The hardest part in finding these skills would likely be the AI to find the foot as this would likely be extremely buggy if it is done in a lazy way. Thus, finding someone with knowledge on 
		AI and recondition software would prove difficult but will likely pay off.</p>
		Outcome <hr />
		<p>The outcome for this is to develop a working application for the desired audience. One which is not too buggy and functions as intended. </p>
